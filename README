This is the source code for the pearhub.org website, where you can register pear packages and have them published.

To make it work, you need to have a couple of dependencies installed on your system, such as svn and git.

You also need to install a cronjob to run the following tasks periodically:

    script/tasks sweep_projects 
    script/tasks build_pending_releases

You might install them to run every 5 minutes or so, in sequence.
